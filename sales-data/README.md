# Customer segmentation analysis carried out using RFM segmentation

Using a [sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data) found on kaggle, I carried out analysis to find out key performing metrics like Customer Monthly Revenue, Customer Monthly Growth Rate, Sales By Region etc. I also did segmentation analysis using recency, monetary and frequency analysis.
